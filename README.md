# Google Cloud Practice Project
During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program, I explored the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.

Professional cloud engineers use a lot of automation and therefore scripting of solutions instead of clicking around in the UI of the web administration. Also using git and version control to store and monitor those scripts is a common use case.

I am gently guided towards this professional handling using both approaches. The translation of Cloud Console instructions to easy to use commands in the Cloud Shell helps to foster the understanding and knowledge of cloud computing in GCP.


# The challenge(s)
The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:

1 Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.

2 “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.

# Solution
The screenshot to the completed labs is provided in directory named screenshot
You can view the [screenshots](SCREENSHOTS.md)


The translation of 3 console instructions have also been provided in the translations directory.
The following Console Instructions were translated.
- [Getting Started with Compute Engine](translations/getting-started-with-app-engine.sh)

- [Getting Started with Kubernetes Engine](translations/getting-started-with-gke.sh)

- [Getting Started with App Engine](translations/getting-started-with-app-engine.sh)

- [Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL](translations/getting-started-with-cloud-storage-and-cloud-sql.sh)
